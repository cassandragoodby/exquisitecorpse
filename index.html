            <p>Have you ever walked around the University of Colorado Boulder and questioned not only the truth of it all but what they may be hiding? It's a path that once you go down it's hard to turn back. This is a story about the very questions and the truths that were found along the way.
            </p>
            
            <p>Last warning...</p>

            <p>Let's get started!</p>

            <p>
            If you have been to the Engineering Center, you probably question the sanity of the architect behind this monstrosity. To understand this story going, I'll tell you the story of Billy the architect and his final project for his architecture degree. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Billy spent the majority of his senior year designing the building for his final. He skipped out on parties, holidays, and even other classes to make the 'perfect building'. His architectural dream.
            </p>
            <p>On the last second of the last day to turn in his assignment, Billy presssed the 'Submit' button. He couldn't have been a prouder architect. 
            </p>
            <p>
            For the next week, Billy sat there refreshing his grade over and over again, eager to see his grade...
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally after seven long days, Billy saw his grade. I was an F. Not even a D. It was an F...
            </p>

            <p>
            Billy was devastated. He felt a rage boiling down deep in his soul. He thundered into the Chancellor's office with his lawyer in tow. The school wouldn't hear the end of this. Billy couldn't easily be bought off with money or good grades. He wanted more. He wanted his crumbled dreams to be put back together in real life.
            </p>

            <p>
            But building his creation wouldn't be that easy...
            </p>

            <p>
            It started off as an accident, a slip up of grabbing the F grade pile instead of the A pile. But slowly but surely Billy's design was chosen from the Dean's committee as the final design for the engineering center, despite the stairwells that led no where, numbers not being chronological and an overall confusing layout.  
            </p>

            <p>
            Ten years passes. Billy had since graduated and moved on with his career and life, not as an architect. He came back for his ten year reunion, and surprise his failure of a design stood in front of him.
            </p>

            <p>
            There was nothing he could do. A contorted pile of concrete and steel stared him in the face. He had only one option...confront the monstrosity head. He descended deep into the belly of the beast. Intent on finding the answer to all his madness. As he tried to navigate the long hallways and confusing acronyms, he found himself getting more and more lost. But what he found in the end left him speechless.
