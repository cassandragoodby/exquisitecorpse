            <p>Have you ever walked around the University of Colorado Boulder and questioned not only the truth of it all but what they may be hiding? It's a path that once you go down it's hard to turn back. This is a story about the very questions and the truths that were found along the way.
            </p>
            
            <p>Last warning...</p>

            <p>Let's get started!</p>

            <p>
            If you have been to the Engineering Center, you probably question the sanity of the architect behind this monstrosity. To understand this story going, I'll tell you the story of Billy the architect and his final project for his architecture degree. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Billy spent the majority of his senior year designing the building for his final. He skipped out on parties, holidays, and even other classes to make the 'perfect building'. His architectural dream.

            On the last second of the last day to turn in his assignment, Billy presssed the 'Submit' button. He couldn't have been a prouder architect.

            For the next week, Billy sat there refreshing his grade over and over again, eager to see his grade...

            Finally after seven long days, Billy saw his grade. I was an F. Not even a D. It was an F...
